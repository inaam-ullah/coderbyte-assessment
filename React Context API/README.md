# React Context API

We provided some simple React template code. Your goal is to modify the application so that when you click the toggle button, the favorite programming language toggles between the items in the languages array.

The default value should be the first item in the array.

You must use the Context API for this challenge, which means you have to use the React. createContext and Context. Provider functions. You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the component ID's and clases provided as they are.
Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.

## Given Code

```bash
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const languages = ['JavaScript', 'Python'];

function App() {
// implement Context here so can be used in child components
    return (
        ‹MainSection />
    );
}

function MainSection () {
    return ( 
        <div>
            <p id="favoriteLanguage">favorite programing language: null</p>
            <button id="changeFavorite">toggle language</button>
        </div>
    );
}

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot (container);
root. render (<App />);
```
